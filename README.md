# Creating-a-Book-Library-App-with-WPF-DataGrid
## Overview 

In this blog, we’ll explore how to build a Book Library App using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), leveraging the MVVM architecture and Syncfusion’s rich UI controls to create a seamless user experience. 

Our goal is to design an intuitive interface where users can: 

View and manage a list of books 

Search, edit, and delete entries 

Filter books by genre using a navigation drawer 

Export the collection to Excel or PDF 

At the heart of this app is the SfDataGrid, a versatile control that allows dynamic data presentation and manipulation. Combined with WPF’s layout system and data binding capabilities, we’ll create a responsive and maintainable application that’s ideal for managing any kind of collection. 

Whether you're building a personal library manager or a scalable enterprise tool, this walkthrough will give you the foundation to extend and customize your app with ease.
